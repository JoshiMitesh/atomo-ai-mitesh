```bash
ffprobe -version
```

---

## 3. Install Node.js

Node.js 20 is recommended.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
```

```bash
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

Verify Node.js:

```bash
node --version
```

Verify npm:

```bash
npm --version
```

The Node.js version should be 18 or newer.

---

## 4. Install Node.js Dependencies

Make sure you are inside the `face_recognition` directory:

```bash
cd atomo-ai-fronend-backend/face_recognition
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

The backend uses:

* Express
* WebSocket
* CORS
* Multer
* dotenv

---

## 5. Create Python Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Upgrade pip:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

---

## 6. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python-headless huggingface-hub
```

Verify the Python dependencies:

```bash
python -c "import cv2, numpy, huggingface_hub; print('Python dependencies installed successfully')"
```

Every time you open a new terminal, activate the environment again:

```bash
cd atomo-ai-fronend-backend/face_recognition
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 7. Prepare MediaMTX

The MediaMTX executable should be available inside:

```text
face_recognition/mediamtx
```

Give execution permission:

```bash
chmod +x mediamtx
```

Verify MediaMTX:

```bash
./mediamtx --version
```

The included MediaMTX binary must match your system architecture.

For example:

* Linux x86-64 requires an amd64 binary
* ARM64 requires an arm64 binary
* ARM32 requires an armv7 binary

---

## 8. Create Runtime Directories

```bash
mkdir -p data uploads crops
```

Give the current user permission:

```bash
chmod -R u+rwX data uploads crops
```

---

# Face Recognition Startup

Use the following steps to start the Atomo AI face recognition service.

## First-Time Setup

From the repository root:

```bash
cd face_recognition
npm install
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy opencv-python-headless huggingface-hub
chmod +x mediamtx
```

The application uses the built-in SQLite support provided by Node.js. The runtime database is created automatically at:

```text
data/face_recognition.db
```

Do not create or restore `data/database.json`; the application no longer uses the JSON database.

## Start Face Recognition

Every time you want to start the service:

```bash
cd face_recognition
source venv/bin/activate
npm start
```

The server starts on:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

When started successfully, the terminal should show messages similar to:

```text
Face Recognition Server is listening on http://localhost:3000
Python face worker is ready.
```

The server automatically starts MediaMTX and the Python face-recognition worker. Active cameras configured in SQLite are resumed automatically.

## Open the Dashboard

On the same machine, open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

From another computer on the same network, find the server IP:

```bash
hostname -I
```

Then open:

```text
http://SERVER_IP:3000
```

Replace `SERVER_IP` with the IP address of the face-recognition server.

---

# Run the Application

## Start the Application

Open the project directory:

```bash
cd atomo-ai-fronend-backend/face_recognition
```

Activate the Python environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

You can also use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start on:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Open this URL in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Open the Application from Another Computer

Find the server IP address:

```bash
hostname -I
```

Example output:

```text
192.168.1.100
```

Open the application from another computer using:

```text
http://192.168.1.100:3000
```

Replace `192.168.1.100` with the actual IP address of the server.

---

Run:

```bash
cd atomo-ai-fronend-backend/face_recognition
```

```bash
npm run reset-db
```

---

# Camera Configuration

The application supports RTSP cameras.

The common RTSP URL format is:

```text
rtsp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@CAMERA_IP:554/STREAM_PATH
```

Example:

```text
rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.116:554/stream1
```

Add the full RTSP URL through the camera management page.

The camera and server should be connected to the same network.

---

## Test RTSP Camera Using FFprobe

```bash
ffprobe \
-v error \
-rtsp_transport tcp \
-select_streams v:0 \
-show_entries stream=codec_name,width,height \
-of default=noprint_wrappers=1 \
"rtsp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@CAMERA_IP:554/STREAM_PATH"
```

Example:

```bash
ffprobe \
-v error \
-rtsp_transport tcp \
-select_streams v:0 \
-show_entries stream=codec_name,width,height \
-of default=noprint_wrappers=1 \
"rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.116:554/stream1"
```

---

## Test RTSP Camera Using FFmpeg

```bash
ffmpeg \
-hide_banner \
-loglevel warning \
-rtsp_transport tcp \
-i "rtsp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@CAMERA_IP:554/STREAM_PATH" \
-t 10 \
-an \
-f null -
```

If the stream is working, FFmpeg will process the video for 10 seconds.
